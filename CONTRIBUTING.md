# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for contributing! 🎉

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with a clear message
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix: port detection bug"
   ```
5. Push the branch
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```
6. Open a Pull Request to `main`

## Rules
- Do NOT push directly to `main` (if you are a maintainer).
- Keep commits small and clear.
- Test before submitting PRs (`npm run dev` and `npm run build:win`).

Happy Coding! 🚀
